# Automate Outlook Email Sends via Python Program

This will serve as a base to email sending needs included in your Python script.  With some clever coding it may:
* schedule deployments at any hour of the day
* use a custom list of email addresses
* make dynamic changes to subject line and body text
* have multiple attachments to include: csv files, ggplot outputs, etc.

This may require
* intermediate programming skills in R
* Microsoft Outlook 2016
* Windows PowerShell Version 5.1
* Python version 3.6.7
